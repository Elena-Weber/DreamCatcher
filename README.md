This is FrontEnd for the project DreamCatcher. The BackEnd is here: https://github.com/Elena-Weber/DreamCatcher-BE.

Have you ever wanted to program your own dreams? Imagine you'd like to become a mermaid, a Wonder Woman, a Terminator or a dolphin for a night. We all know that in real life this is impossible. Or are you dreaming about visiting Ancient Rome or present-day North Pole? Not possible again! But wait a minute - there's nothing that you can't do in your dream. Human dreams have no limits and no boundaries! And I can help you with that.
DreamCatcher is a workshop for dreams from the future. This is a single page application (SPA).
Here is the application's functionality: it's full CRUD (a user can create, read, update and delete dreams). Each dream has a name and a description. The user can also search for a dream, filter dreams by alphabet and creation day and change background image by clicking buttons.

Installation

Fork the project's frontend from https://github.com/Elena-Weber/DreamCatcher and cd into the project folder.

Usage

To start the server, run in your terminal:
$ yarn start
If the browser page doesn't open on its own, open up a new tab in your browser (Chrome is recommended) and go to this page http://localhost:3001/. You should see the main (and only) page of the project. To stop the server, while in your terminal, press Control+C (for MacBook).
